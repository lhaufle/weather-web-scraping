# weather-web-scraping
1) This script scrapes data from a website that is local to me to get the 10 day lows and highs. 
   After the data is harvested, it the scrapes the data from the national weather service and pulls a 7 day desciption
   for both day and evenings.

2) The values from that are scraped from the local site are used to create a barchart that is turned into a png then
   inserted into an excel file. 

3) The values from the national weather service are written below the barchart in the excel sheet.
